Title: Implementation of Residual Balancing Weights for Marginal Structural Models
Version: 0.1.1

Description: Residual balancing is an efficient and robust method of constructing
  weights for marginal structural models, which can be used to estimate marginal
  effects of time-varying treatments and also controlled direct/mediator effects in
  causal mediation analysis. This package provides two functions, rbwPanel() and rbwMed(),
  that produce residual balancing weights for analyses of time-varying treatments and
  causal mediation respectively.
