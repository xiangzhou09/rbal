Title: Residual Balancing Weights for Marginal Structural Models
Version: 0.2.0

Description: Residual balancing is a robust method of constructing weights for
  marginal structural models, which can be used to estimate marginal effects of
  time-varying treatments and controlled direct/mediator effects in causal mediation
  analysis (Zhou and Wodtke 2020 <doi:10.1017/pan.2020.2>). This
  package provides two main functions, rbwPanel() and rbwMed(), that produce
  residual balancing weights for analyzing time-varying treatments and
  causal mediation respectively.
