\title{Residual Balancing Weights for Causal Mediation Analysis}
\usage{
rbwMed(
  treatment,
  mediator,
  zmodels,
  data,
  baseline_x,
  interact = FALSE,
  base_weights,
  max_iter = 200,
  print_level = 1,
  tol = 1e-04
)
}
\arguments{
\item{treatment}{A symbol or character string for the treatment variable.}

\item{mediator}{A symbol or character string for the mediator variable.}

\item{zmodels}{A list of fitted \code{lm} or \code{glm} objects for
post-treatment confounders of the mediator-outcome relationship. If there's no
post-treatment confounder, set it to be \code{NULL}.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing all variables in the model.}

\item{baseline_x}{(Optional) Expression for a set of baseline confounders stored in \code{data}.}

\item{interact}{A logical variable indicating whether baseline and post-treatment covariates
should be balanced against the treatment-mediator interaction term(s).}

\item{base_weights}{(Optional) A vector of base weights (or its name).}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iterations for Newton's method.}

\item{print_level}{The level of printing: 1 (normal printing), 2 (detailed),
and 3 (very detailed).}

\item{tol}{Tolerance parameter used to determine convergence.}
}
\value{
A list containing the results.
 \item{weights}{A vector of residual balancing weights.}
 \item{constraints}{A matrix of (linearly independent) residual balancing constraints}
 \item{eb_out}{Results from calling \code{\link{eb2}} function}
 \item{call}{The matched call.}
}
\description{
\code{rbwMed} is a function that produces residual balancing weights for
causal mediation analysis. The weights can be used to fit marginal
structural models for the joint effects of the treatment and a mediator.
